# Full-Stack Project Starter Template

This is a **full-stack starter template** for students to build their projects.  
It has a structured folder setup with separate **client**, **server**, and **database** directories, making it easy to organize your application logic and development workflow.

## Project Structure

project-root/
├── client/ # Frontend application (React, Vue, etc.)
├── server/ # Backend application (Laravel, Node.js, etc.)
└── database/ # Database migrations, seeders, or SQL scripts


- **client**: Your frontend code, responsible for UI and API requests.
- **server**: The backend code (Laravel API in this template) handling business logic and serving API endpoints.
- **database**: Database schema, migrations, and seed data.
